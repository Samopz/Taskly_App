# TASKLY_APP CAPSTONE PROJECT

TASKLY_APP is a task management application that helps users manage their tasks efficiently. It includes features such as task assignment, notifications for due dates, and rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Features

- **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to users and notify them when they are assigned.
- **Due Date Notifications**: Notify users when their tasks are due in 1 day, 12 hours, and 1 hour.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.
- **Authentication**: Secure the application using Auth0 middleware.

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=

Start the application:
